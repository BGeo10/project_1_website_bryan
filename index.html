    <h2>Destiny</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Destiny is a first-person shooter that was developed by Bungie, the creators of the famous Halo franchise, and was published by Activision. The video game was released worldwide on September 9th, 2014 for the PS4, PS3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 gaming consoles. But unlike Bungie's Halo series that was exclusive to Xbox, Destiny is a franchise for both Playstation and Xbox users to enjoy in a ten-year agreement with Activision. Destiny is set in a science fiction multiplayer "shared-world" environment with some characteristics of role-playing games. The actvities that players can participate in Destiny are divided into player versus environment and player versus player game modes. For short the game modes are (PvE) and (PvP).

    <h3>Destiny's Setting</h3>
    <p>Destiny is a game that is set 700 years into the future after a great period of exploration, peace, and technical advancements that was known as the Golden Age. During the Golden Age humans traveled to many planets across the Solar System with the help of "the Traveler", creating colonies among the stars. Some of the colonized planets during the Golden Age were Venus and Mars, as well as The Moon. Very soon though a catastrophic event called "the Collapse" brought the mysterious force of the Darkness, an acient enemy of "the Traveler" that destroyed everything that had been brought by the Golden Age of exploration. The only survivors from "the Collapse" were the ones living on Earth where "the Traveler" is now set above The Last City on Earth that is surrounded by an extremely large wall to prevent the Darkness's alien forces from penetrating into the city.</p>
